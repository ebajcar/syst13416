                <h3>Course Content <span class="label label-warning">Added</span></h3>
                <!-- -->
                <p>Course <strong class="text-danger">content</strong> is nothing more nor less than <strong class="text-danger">a mode of thinking</strong>. All areas of study are "things" that we are interested in "figuring out". There is no way to figure out something without thinking, without learning how to think it through.  There is no way to learn computing content without learning how to figure out correct answers to computing questions and problems.  Any content can therefore be understood as a mode of figuring out correct or reasonable answers to a certain body of questions. </p>
                <p>All content involves <strong class="text-danger">concepts</strong>. There is no way to learn a body of content without learning the concepts which define and structure it. There is no way to learn a concept without learning how to use it in thinking something through. To learn the concept of computing is to learn how to figure out how computers work and how to give them instructions to get a specific result. To learn any body of content, therefore, it is necessary to learn to think accurately and reasonably with the concepts that define the content.</p>
                <p>All content is logically interdependent. To understand one part of some content requires that we figure out its relation to other parts of that content. To learn any body of content is to figure out, reason or think through, the <strong class="text-danger">connections</strong> among the parts of that content. There is no learning of the content without this thinking process.</p>
                <p class="bg-danger">Treat course content, as a mode of thinking, as a system for thought, not as a sequence of stuff to be routinely covered and committed to memory. </p>

            <li>You learn computer programming by doing it. To do well in this course, you need to be actively engaged. This means coming to class on time, paying attention, taking notes, using class time to complete exercises and assignments, working on exercises and assignments outside of class time, and actively seeking help from the professor, other students, on-line resources and textbooks. If you miss a class for any reason, you should look at SLATE as soon as you can and contact the professor and other students to find out what you missed.</li>

	<h2>Classroom Policies</h2>
	<h3>Test &amp; Assignment Policy</h3>
		<ul>
		<li>All assignments must be uploaded using the appropriate SLATE dropbox. Assignments not uploaded to the SLATE dropbox will not be graded.</li>
		<li>Unless other arrangements have been agreed upon in advance with the professor (that means well BEFORE the due date), all assignments are subject to a late penalty of 10% per day (including weekends).</li>
		<li>Late assignments will only be accepted up to five (5) days after the due date (including weekends).</li>
		<li>If you know you will be missing a test it is your responsibility to inform the instructor BEFORE the test date to make alternate arrangements.</li>
		<li>A doctor's note will be required to rewrite any test or quiz missed for medical reasons.</li>
		<li>There will be no make-ups for missed In-Class exercises or quizzes.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3>Academic Honesty &amp; Collaboration Policy</h3>
	<p>Unless stated otherwise, students are encouraged to work together and help each other with homework, assignments and the general understanding of course material. Collaboration is an effective way for students to learn and understand the material in this course. Some ways of collaborating however, are more productive than others and some ways are no help at all.</p>
	<h4>Good collaboration practices</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>Discussing course material and problems with other students at a high level provided that nobody takes detailed notes which are later incorporated into an assignment.</li>
		<li>Helping another student locate the information they need for the homework or assignment.</li>
		<li>Testing and reading another student's program to look for small mistakes.</li>
		<li>Sitting with someone to advise them while they write or debug a something they are having trouble with.</li>
	</ul>
	<h4>Bad collaboration practices (which are considered plagiarism)</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>Writing a part of somebody's assignment for them.</li>
		<li>Sending somebody your homework or assignments so they can use it as a template, cut and paste parts of it, or change it slightly and hand it in as their own.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>To protect yourself against academic honesty issues it is good practice to <em>always lock your computer or logout when leaving it unattended</em>. Also, when discussing approaches to solutions with your classmates, avoid taking too many notes. Recreating the solution later from memory will help prevent identical assignment submissions or submissions which are suspiciously similar.</p>
