	<h4>Complete all of the following steps:</h4>
    <p>IMPORTANT! Before you start the assignment, make sure you understand the <code>history</code> command. You will be submitting a snapshot of your history that needs to contain all of the commands used to complete the assignment.  DO NOT CHANGE OR REMOVE ANYTHING from the history snapshot.  Marks will not be deducted for having a couple of extra attempts containing errors, AND  marks will be deducted if any commands are missing or if the content of the file has been modified, or contains unrelated entries! This is not a time-consuming assignment and it is worth your while to complete the assignment in its entirely a second time!</p>
