	<h2 class="highlight-3">Processes and Utilities (from Module 5)</h2>

		</ul>
		<h3>Sample Questions:</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>True or False?  A process is the operating system execution of a program. When you log in, the process running is normally a shell, called a login shell. When you enter a command at the prompt, the shell has the responsibility of finding the command and arranging for the command to be executed. This is done with system calls. A system call is a request for kernel services.</li>
			<li>True or False?  A utility performs a task that is frequently related to the operating system. A utility is simpler than an application program, although no clear line separates the two. Linux
distributions include many utilities. You can also download many utilities
from the Internet. Examples of utilities are cp (copies a file), ls (lists information about files), and ssh (securely connects to a remote computer).</li>
			<li class="clear">This command displays all processes you have currently running, or stopped, which are associated with your terminal:
				<ol class="optns">
					<li>fg</li>
					<li>bg</li>
					<li>jobs</li>
					<li>top </li>
					<li>free </li>
				</ol>
